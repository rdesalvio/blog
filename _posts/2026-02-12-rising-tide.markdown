As AI continues to diffuse throughout the world of software, I have found a ton of joy in it enabling me to explore ideas that I have always had but were just out of reach. I think there is a lot of value in the short term for creating new software that challenges an existing space which benefited from being that zone of "just enough work to be too much to try", and per usual, I applied it to hockey.

During the fantasy hockey season, I do the same things at the beginning of every week and then on a daily basis. Weekly I will look at what teams have the most games that week and evaluate which players are "hot". Daily I tend to look at which goalies are starting and then do a lighter version of identifying which players are performing well and which teams have the most remaining games.

Performing all of these tasks uses different tools. Typically I use a combination of [Goaliepost](https://goaliepost.com/) and [dailyfaceoff](https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/starting-goalies) for determining starting goalies (they both have their pros/cons). Then I will look at dailyfaceoff again for team's games by week and a combination of ESPN and Yahoo for individual player stats. 

I've grown tired of switching between the different sites and most of their mobile experiences are bad. They are ad-ridden and hard to navigate. Some are better than others but then I am still forced to navigate between all of them. None of these websites are doing anything difficult, and it's a problem I have long recognized but haven't really had the desire or will to fix.

It's in spaces like this where AI becomes a rising tide which lifts all boats. A project that was perhaps just out of reach before, becomes easily within reach. So I made [nhlfantasydata](http://www.nhlfantasydata.com/). It's intentionally a barebones, ad-less, and speedy site which surfaces the information I want easily. The data is split between tabs which can easily be navigated between. It's mobile friendly and hosted/automated using the free tier of Github.

Is this site the best ever? No. But I think it fills a nice void as an ad-less alternative to some pretty bloated sites.
